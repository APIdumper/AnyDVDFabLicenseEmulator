# DVDFabServerEmulator

A simple and efficient server emulator for DVDFab products; including DVDFab, StreamFab, MusicFab and more...

## Installation

Download the distribution (`DVDFabServerEmulator.zip`) and unpack it to a directory you can easily access.

Afterwards, run the runtime script (`start.bat`) and enjoy! You can now install and use any DVDFab software locally without having to connect to external authentication servers.

Please note that you will need to keep the emulator/proxy running whilst using DVDFab software.

## Notes

This project is not affiliated with StreamFab or any other subsidiary of DVDFab and is only intended to allow legitimately licensed users of the DVDFab software suite to use their rightfully purchased software offline without having to connect to an offshore authentication server.

It is not intended to promote or encourage piracy of any kind, and should only be used by legitimate owners of DVDFab software.
