# DVDFabServerEmulator

A simple and efficient server emulator for DVDFab products; including DVDFab, StreamFab, MusicFab and more...

## Installation

- Download the latest distribution of [DVDFabServerEmulator.zip](https://github.com/APIdumper/AnyDVDFabLicenseEmulator/releases/download/1.1/DVDFabServerEmulator.zip) from the releases tab and unpack it to a directory you can easily access.
- Afterwards, run the runtime script (`start.bat`) and enjoy! You can now install and use any DVDFab software locally without having to connect to external authentication servers.

Please note that you will need to keep the emulator/proxy running whilst using DVDFab software.

It is recommended to run the clean-up script (`stop.bat`) to disconnect from the local proxy after you're done using it, as it can interfere with other programs.
